# Long Short Term Memory(LSTM)

Examples for LSTM networks based on time series and sequential data.

## Examples

1. Time Series (tsc) - Build LSTM Neural Network for prediciton mortality in hospital ICU.
2. Sequential Data (sc) - Classify Univariante Time Series Data.

## Data Sets

1. Time series data [Physionet 2012](https://dl4jdata.blob.core.windows.net/training/physionet2012/physionet2012.tar.gz)
2. Sequential data [University of California Irvine](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/synthetic_control-mld/synthetic_control.data)

## Build And Run
```
mvn clean install

java -jar lstm.jar <command>
```
